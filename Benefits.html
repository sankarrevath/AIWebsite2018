General Electricâ€™s Predix operating system powers a number of industries such as oil, aviation, and gas by processing the performance data of equipment. Predix, however, can also process large amounts of info recorded over a large gap of time to help forecast the future. Predictive analytics forecasts the future as a function of the past. Predix can calculate when maintenance is necessary for devices, cars, trucks, and etc. and then schedules repairs before a failure occurs. This can minimize the time the system is down, schedule maintenance, and even reduce costs to operate. <a href="http://www.jeromes.com/inspire/would-you-use-virtual-reality-to-decorate-your-home">Image Source</a></p>

      <p class="section-text">It can very difficult for one teacher to figure out how to meet the necessities of every student in his/her classroom. AI systems used by online education websites easily accommodate to each studentâ€™s learning needs and can identify what to teach based on their strengths and weaknesses.Artificial Intelligence can determine any holes in the subject based on studentâ€™s performance on the tests assigned by the site. For example, if a large amount of students answered a question wrong, the companyâ€™s AI can focus on the concepts that students do not understand so that the teachers can target which areas to help the student with and suggest improvements in materials that were assigned. In this generation, students are increasingly afraid about being embarrassed in front of teachers and their friends by asking questions. This prevents them from receiving feedback in school and it makes it hard for teachers to determine if the student understands the materials. With AI technology, students can feel a lot more relaxed and are more inclined to make the mistakes necessary for learning and receive the feedback they need for improvement. <a href="https://infinityleap.com/22-augmented-reality-education-vr-classroom-apps/">Image Source</a>

The secretary tells you that you have to wait three more days until you can get an appointment with your doctor. Frustrated, you donâ€™t know what to do. You watch an advertisement about Babylon and its new app. You immediately search this up and you find out that the online medical consultation company, Babylon has launched an application which offers medical AI examination based on past medical history and its database of medical knowledge. You read that customers brief their symptoms to the app, which checks what illness they have based on a database of illnesses. After processing the patientâ€™s records and status, Babylon offers proper instructions on how to act. Babylonâ€™s app will also suggest patients to take their medicine at the appropriate times, and will follow up make sure theyâ€™re doing fine.

      <p class="info-bar-text">AI in healthcare has the potential to organize treatment plans more efficiently and will also equip physicians with all the information necessary to the make the correct choice. Artificial Intelligence has already found multiple areas in healthcare to remodel, starting from the methods of the treatment plans to drug creation Evolving medicine through scientific trials may take more a long time and would cost massive amounts of money. Making this process more efficient through cost and time would have a colossal effect on todayâ€™s healthcare. This would also make innovations reach ordinary medicine. This is where a company like Atomwise comes in. Atomwise operates supercomputers that find the source of the therapies from a database of different molecular structures. Furthermore, Atomwise introduced a virtual search for safe, pre existing medicines that could be remade to aid the fight against Ebola. Atomwise found two different drugs using the companyâ€™s AI. The medicines that Atomwise found may significantly lessen Ebola infectivity. This search was completed in less than one day.
