        <p class="section-text">The development of artificial intelligence has quickly ramped up, as the projected market for augmented reality in 2035 is about $14 trillion. However, it is also important to look before we leap and to seriously consider the arguments against artificial intelligence. The use of artificial intelligence can cause general cognitive problems, such as distraction and information overload, health issues, and intense privacy complications. As artificial intelligence continues to become more and more popular in the commercial industries, the arguments against it will also become more visible in the public eye.</p><!--this is done, maybe redo the list-->      </div>

      <h2 class="section-title">Security Vulnerabilities</h2>
      <p class="section-text">One major risk of artificial intelligence is the fact that it could possibly be weaponized. Semi-autonomous weapons like unmanned drones are already in the air, but currently they are controlled by the military who choose where to drop missiles or where to conduct surveillance. The risk is that completely autonomous weapons could be developed, and these weapons would be scientifically proven, programmed, and skilled at only one thing, to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could cause mass casualties, and with hackers constantly trying to break other countries’ AI weapon devices, one mistake could lead to the loss of control of these weapons, possibly leading to many deaths<!-- this is done redo links--> <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/augmented-driving/id366841514?mt=8">Image Source</a>

      <h2 class="section-title">Job Risks</h2>
      <p class="section-text">Another risk of artificial intelligence is that with the rapid development that is occurring up to this point, soon AI will be able to replace jobs that are currently occupied by humans. Even just recently, many jobs in factories have been taken over by robots that do the task faster and without as much need for pay. With the development of AI, even higher skilled jobs such as accounting will be replaced by robots, which use artificial intelligence and algorithms to help them solve intricate money problems that, at this moment, only humans can accurately fix. At that point, citizens risk losing their livelihood to artificial intelligence. Many believe that AI will create jobs, just that the skill cap of jobs will be much higher, meaning that the lower class will fall behind if they cannot stay ahead and learn as they are doing lower pay jobs such as waiting or being cashiers. <!--this is done, redo link-->

      <p class="section-text"> Thousands of men in Japan have begun to marry in virtual reality. They have actual weddings with womens completely created by artificial intelligence, women that they can only see by wearing a virtual reality device. The distractions of the virtual reality has become so potent that these men will spend most of the time they are awake wasting their time in virtual reality to be with their artificial “other halfs” in the artificial intelligent devices that they possess.

      <h2 class="section-title">Opening the Door to our Lives</h2>
      <p class="section-text">The door to abuse artificial intelligence technology is ajar, but as the technology improves, there is legitimate concern that the door into our private lives will be thrown wide open. The constant supply of information that artificial intelligence requires can be used to enhance the experience, but it can also be stockpiled in massive data banks by powerful companies in the emerging space. This data can be distributed to enterprising companies and abused by domineering governments. Recent developments, such as SNAP_R from ZeroFox, show that individuals have the ability to use internet technologies, such as social media bots, to gain insight into the lives of citizens. With the onset of augmented reality, this potential for abuse will only be increased as powerful entities will be able to access devices that constantly track and monitor our lives. <!--this is done--><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_16_(UK)">Image Source</a>

      <h2 class="section-title">Hacking the System</h2>
      <p class="section-text">Companies and governments are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the privacy concerns of augmented reality. Hackers have already infiltrated the data banks of augmented reality companies by scamming users and then accessing all of their stored information. The increased focus on augmented reality will ultimately attract more hackers, who will exploit new ways to harm people. For example, hackers could prey on epileptic people by playing bright flashing lights or cause mayhem on the roads by replacing speed signs with higher speeds and erasing warning signs from the user's view. They can also take control of augmented reality systems within cars and planes and impede the vision of drivers and pilots.Protecting the data that is placed in artificial models is extremely intelligent. Machines need data, whether to compute or to function, and if that data is hacked then lots of privacy can be lost. As most machine learning models have begun to store their data in the cloud, the risk for privacy is ever present. Users of artificial intelligence machines will need to send data to the machine to help it do its work better, and this data may be easily hacked which will result in a great loss of privacy. <a href="http://hero.wikia.com/wiki/File:Anonymous_hacker_logo.png">Image Source</a>

      <h1 class="section-title">Ultromics: Case Study</h1>
      <p class="section-text">In some cases, the risk of artificial intelligence can actually be attributed to the amount of data that is put into it. For example, BBC reported that an AI system was created to determine the relationship between patients in hospitals’ death rates with the affliction, or illness, that they had. The AI system learned that patients with pneumonia had a higher chance of death. However, the machine did not have any data on the risk of pneumonia in patients that already had asthma. Patients with both are at an extremely high risk of death and must go straight to intensive care to make sure that they can live. However, the machine was not able to associate this relationship and so it placed the patients with both pneumonia and asthma at a lower risk of death so they would receive care later than patients with only pneumonia. As artificial intelligence systems are created to assess and make decisions on multitudes of tasks in the future, mistakes such as this can be very costly if they are not carefully monitored and watched.  <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-42357257">Image Source</a></p>
