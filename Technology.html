        <p class="section-text">Artificial Intelligence is a technological concept that has only been imagined and explored since the dawn of science fiction. A subset of virtual environments in general, augmented reality revolves around virtual items being superimposed on the real world. Unlike its often interchangeably misused cousin, virtual reality, artificial intelligence does not place the user in an entirely new space. Instead, depending on the level of augmentation, the user is exposed to an overlay of information, pictures, and in more extreme cases, virtual objects. While various versions had been conceived and manufactured during the 20th century, the technology for truly impressive artificial intelligence has only come to fruition in the 21st century.</p>      </div>

      <p class="section-text">Artificial intelligence, contrary to popular belief, has been around longer than most everyday people realize. The first recognized use of AI was Samuelâ€™s Checkers program in 1959 which brought on a slew of firsts; including first use of machine learning and first use of truncated search and evaluation functions. Only two years later, GM introduced the first industrial robot which set the precedent of technology having a larger role in the workplace. It was not until ten years later, in 1971, that the dawn of classical symbolic AI was introduced. This form of AI had the program implement logic and modeled the world around it using abstract symbols. Within a decade, the 1980s brought forth the pioneer forms of neural networks that we see remnants of in AI work today.

      <h2 class="section-title">Modern Day AI</h2>
      <p class="section-text">Artificial intelligence from the 1990s to the present has grown exponentially faster compared to the later half of the 20th century. The 90s introduced probabilistic graphical models, heavy machine learning, and innovative product designs. All of this led to recent progress in probabilistic relational models, deep networks, and structured prediction. Furthermore, the most advanced accomplishment is unarguably active learning, since developers themselves do not know what this could bring. Active learning allows for AI to essentially make itself smarter and think in ways similar to living creatures. As of now, the possibilities are endless if human beings can fine tune this feature.

      <p class="section-text">Artificial intelligence in the future has many unknowns dependent upon human advancement in data storage and computing power. Skeptics and pop culture enthusiasts seem to believe in an AI revolution where robots will overtake humanity in a Terminator-esque overthrow. Similarly, shows such as Black Mirror and Altered Carbon make it clear that technology will bring more harm than good. However, these scenarios remain highly unlikely, if not altogether impossibly. Instead, the AI future should rather continue to bring on the advent of smart products, such as intelligent homes, appliances, vehicles, and infrastructure. Since this tech is to be used as assistance rather than replacement, progress shall be made in this field until there is nowhere further to go.

      <h1 class="section-title">IBM Watson: Case Study</h1>
      <p class="section-text">The Watson supercomputer processes at a rate of 80 teraflops (trillion floating-point operations per second). To replicate (or surpass) a high-functioning human's ability to answer questions, Watson accesses 90 servers with a combined data store of over 200 million pages of information, which it processes against six million logic rules. Applications for the Watson's underlying cognitive computing technology are almost endless. Because the device can perform text mining and complex analytics on huge volumes of unstructured data, it can support a search engine or an expert system with capabilities far superior to any previously existing. In May 2016, BakerHostetler, a century-old Ohio-based law firm, signed a contract for a legal expert system based on Watson to work with its 50-human bankruptcy team. ROSS can mine data from about a billion text documents, analyze the information and provide precise responses to complicated questions in less than three seconds. Natural language processing allows the system to translate legalese to respond to the lawyers' questions. ROSS' creators are adding more legal modules; similar expert systems are transforming medical research.To showcase its abilities, Watson challenged two top-ranked players on Jeopardy! and beat champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011. The Watson avatar sat between the two other contestants, as a human competitor would, while its considerable bulk sat on a different floor of the building. Like the other contestants, Watson had no Internet access. Rutter noted that although the retrieval of information is "trivial" for Watson and difficult for a human, the human is still better at the complex task of comprehension. Nevertheless, machine learning allows Watson to examine its mistakes against the correct answers to see where it erred and so inform future responses.
