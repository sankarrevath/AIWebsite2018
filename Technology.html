        <p class="section-text">Artificial Intelligence is a technological concept that has only been imagined and explored since the dawn of science fiction. A subset of virtual environments in general, augmented reality revolves around virtual items being superimposed on the real world. Unlike its often interchangeably misused cousin, virtual reality, artificial intelligence does not place the user in an entirely new space. Instead, depending on the level of augmentation, the user is exposed to an overlay of information, pictures, and in more extreme cases, virtual objects. While various versions had been conceived and manufactured during the 20th century, the technology for truly impressive artificial intelligence has only come to fruition in the 21st century.</p>      </div>

      <h2 class="section-title"><a id="past">AI in the Past</a></h2>
      <p class="section-text">The first concept of augmented reality was described in a 1901 novel by Frank Baum, regarding a pair of electronic glasses. Despite this early conception, the idea itself lacked a name until a Boeing researcher, Tom Caudell, named it Augmented Reality in 1990. Augmented reality, in a sense, had already been in use for some time by then; US experimental planes were outfitted with prototype heads up displays as early as the 1950s. These basic baby steps provided static information such as compass directions and altitude. However, Caudell's name and his work sparked interest and growth in the field. His head-tracking system for wiring the new 777 airliner was limited by slow responses and weak portable computers. The problem posed by inefficient batteries, low resolution portable cameras, and lack of computational power continued to stump augmented reality technology researchers until the 21st century. By 2004, the advent of powerful cell phones made possible by Moore's Law, an observation that theorized that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years, allowed German researchers to bring see-through augmented reality into the realm of possibility for all. In the last decade, rapid advances in the field have lead to the proliferation of wearable smart glasses like the Google Glass and real-time heads up displays in transportation like BMW's holographic dashboard.

      <h2 class="section-title">Modern Day AI</h2>
      <p class="section-text">Modern day augmented reality technology is rapidly advancing, improving by leaps and bounds. For the first time ever, augmented reality is seeing widespread mainstream usage. Snapchat, released 5 years ago, has morphed into a multibillion dollar company thanks to the popularity of its filters. These filters, like Google Translate's new photo translation, rely on complex machine-vision algorithms to parse information from the real world and alter it on screen for users. Furthermore, despite the widely anticipated and mildly panned release of Google Glass just 3 years ago in 2014, companies like Innovega are already working on the next step - augmented reality contact lenses. Industrial giants like Microsoft and Google as well as startups like Magic Leap have developed headsets capable of scanning reality and subsequently overlaying in depth, detailed holograms straight into the user's eyes. These holograms are convincing enough for medical students to practice dissection with real tools on virtual cadavers. Phone technology is being pushed to its boundaries as a steady stream of apps have taken advantage of high resolution cameras to provide even greater utility. "Measure", a Google app that utilizes next generation phone camera sensors, can measure house dimensions and distances; these can subsequently be exported to a floor plan program that can generate your house blueprints. <a href="http://www.androidmodo.com/5056/nueva-version-google-glass-con-audifono-prescripciones/">Image Source</a>

      <p class="section-text">As augmented reality takes hold in the mainstream, greater demand means greater problems. End user diversity will require a wide array of viewing and controlling options that will not be satisfied by traditional touch or mouse usage. Despite Moore's Law, the computational demands of augmented reality means that truly portable usage on the level of a Hololens headset isn't there yet. Our mastery of lithium batteries provide enough charge for everyday usage, but as the public as quickly found out, rarely satisfies heavy usage of augmented reality apps like Snapchat or Pokemon Go. Headsets too, have run into significant issues barring their widespread adoption: namely cost, application, and fashionability. The extreme cost of entry to the field prevents the mainstream from embracing more immersive and helpful augmented reality technology, which in turn keeps developers from creating useful applications for the instruments. This catch-22 will be the greatest challenge going forward, and can only be solved with the creation of an efficient, long-lasting, immersive, preferably three dimensional, screen-less electronic, with tactile feedback and gestural control. <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/ar-vr-technology-discussion,3811.html">Image Source</a>

      <h1 class="section-title">IBM Watson: Case Study</h1>
      <p class="section-text">The Watson supercomputer processes at a rate of 80 teraflops (trillion floating-point operations per second). To replicate (or surpass) a high-functioning human's ability to answer questions, Watson accesses 90 servers with a combined data store of over 200 million pages of information, which it processes against six million logic rules. Applications for the Watson's underlying cognitive computing technology are almost endless. Because the device can perform text mining and complex analytics on huge volumes of unstructured data, it can support a search engine or an expert system with capabilities far superior to any previously existing. In May 2016, BakerHostetler, a century-old Ohio-based law firm, signed a contract for a legal expert system based on Watson to work with its 50-human bankruptcy team. ROSS can mine data from about a billion text documents, analyze the information and provide precise responses to complicated questions in less than three seconds. Natural language processing allows the system to translate legalese to respond to the lawyers' questions. ROSS' creators are adding more legal modules; similar expert systems are transforming medical research.To showcase its abilities, Watson challenged two top-ranked players on Jeopardy! and beat champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in 2011. The Watson avatar sat between the two other contestants, as a human competitor would, while its considerable bulk sat on a different floor of the building. Like the other contestants, Watson had no Internet access. Rutter noted that although the retrieval of information is "trivial" for Watson and difficult for a human, the human is still better at the complex task of comprehension. Nevertheless, machine learning allows Watson to examine its mistakes against the correct answers to see where it erred and so inform future responses.
